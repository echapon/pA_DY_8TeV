DYanalysis

* AccEff/Acc_Eff.C: produce acceptance / efficiency
* AccEff/DrawAccEffPlot.C: draw them
* AccEff/compareAccEff.C: compare acceptance efficiency with different settings
* AccEff/acceptance_study.C: toy MC for acceptance vs pt and mass, depending on single muon cuts
* ControlPlots/MuonPlots.C: draw control plots, for data or MC
* ControlPlots/ratioplots*: compare the control plots for different settings / MC / run periods...

* BkgEst/interface/defs.h: luminosity, binning, ...
* BkgEst/interface/samples_v*.h: information about samples (path, cross section, ...)
* Include/DYAnalyzer.h: main header with basic functions (selection, etc.)
* Include/NtupleHandle.h: read the ntuple and fill branches
* HIstuff: for HF reweighting
